# PHP CLASSES ASSIGNMENT

Create a multi-layer PHP class setup to describe some related data and functionality.

### How to do
1. A hierarchy of PHP classes representing given animal-related items must be created.
2. The parent (animal) class must implement three methods. "Eat", "Drink", "Speak".
3. Canine and Feline classes should also implement "run," and Bird class should implement "fly."
4. Need a public folder and index.php. This folder can be used the spl_autoload_register used in the index.php. In addition, var_dump is required to implement each class method.
5. Add list additional references/resources used in the README.md file in the GitHub repository.
